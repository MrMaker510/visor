# Visor

In a nutshell: "Visor provides a systemwide terminal window accessible via a hotkey, much like the consoles found in games such as Quake."

This is my fork of the project, as I wanted to have some additional features and some bugs fixed.  Currently this is what is different from the original:

* Fixed the "White Line Bug" ([Issue 16](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-visor/issues/detail?id=16))
* Added the option to hide Visor on Escape press.
  Press Shift+Escape, if you need a "Escape" in the Terminal.
* If you start Visor you get now initial focus. ([Issue 20](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-visor/issues/detail?id=20))

Please see the [original website](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-visor/) for more information, the issue tracker and so on.
